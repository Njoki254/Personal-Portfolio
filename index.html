      <div class="jumbotron"><h1>Njoki Kamau</h1><p> My experiences, academic and professional, reflect a coherent narrative geared towards
       positively impacting the lives of the marginalized in society through enhancing education opportunities, formal and
        informal. For three and a half years, I've worked in the socio-economic development of vulnerable
         groups in the US, UK, and Kenya. I am well suited to positions that require analyzing complex information to find the most holistic solutions to socio-economic issues in Africa. My areas of expertise are Economics, Philosophy, Social Policy (Education, Behavioral Economics, Urbanisation of the Global South), Data Science (Stata, Python, Gretl). I've also done extensive research on policy areas I am most keen on: education, liberation technology, social movements, the informal labor market, and environmental stewardship.I particularly aspire to <span1 > strengthen accountability systems in Kenya through development policy advising,software development and data science.</span> </p></div>
